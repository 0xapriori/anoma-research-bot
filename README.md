#Anomabot

This is a bot that should take new posts from the Anoma research forum create a two bullet point tldr, and explain it to me like I'm five explanation with anthropic's LLM API and then post to the @anomabot twitter account. Currently the project is being hosted via pythonanywhere. I am still debugging the code and do not reccomend forking the code base at this time.
